Mesh provide a collection of useful UI components, so you can easily include web3 functionality and convenient utilities for your application.

## Connect Wallet

In order for pps to communicate with the user's wallet, we need a way to connect to their wallet.

Add this CardanoWallet to allow the user to select a wallet to connect to your app. After the wallet is connected, see <Link href="/apis/wallets/browserwallet">Browser Wallet</Link> for a list of CIP-30 APIs.

The signature for the CardanoWallet component is as follows:

```tsx
{
  label?: string;
  onConnected?: Function;
  isDark?: boolean;
}
```

### Customization [!toc]

For dark mode style, add isDark.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet isDark={true} />
```

For a custom label, add the label prop.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet label={"Connect Wallet"} />
```

The customization is limited. For more customization, you can easily build your own wallet connection component. If you are using React, the <Link href="/react/wallet-hooks">React hooks</Link> will be useful. You may also take reference from <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-react/src/cardano-wallet/index.tsx">this component</Link>.

### Persist user session [!toc]

If you would like to save the user last connected wallet and automatically connect to it on the next visit, you can use the persist prop.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet
  persist={true}
/>
```

### onConnected [!toc]

If you want to run a function after the wallet is connected, you can add the onConnected prop.

```tsx
export default function Page() {

  function afterConnectedWallet() {
    // do something
  }

  return (
    <>
      <CardanoWallet onConnected={afterConnectedWallet} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The above code will log "Hello, World!" to the console when the wallet is connected.

### Mesh Web3 Services [!toc]

<Link href="https://web3.meshjs.dev/">Mesh Web3 Services</Link> streamline user onboarding and on-chain feature integration, accelerating your app's time to market.

To integrate Mesh Web3 Services, use the `web3Services` prop. The `networkId` is the network ID of the wallet you are connecting to. You may use any <Link href="/providers/">providers</Link> for `fetcher` and `submitter`.

```tsx
const provider = new BlockfrostProvider('<BLOCKFROST_API_KEY>');

<CardanoWallet
  web3Services={{
    networkId: 0,
    fetcher: provider,
    submitter: provider,
  }}
/>
```

### Decentralized WebRTC Wallet Communication (CIP 45) [!toc]

<Link href="https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-45">CIP-45</Link> is a communication method between pps and wallets based on WebTorrent trackers and WebRTC. Using WebTorrent trackers for the peer discovery to remove the need of this central component.

### Burner wallet [!toc]

Burner wallets are wallets that are created on the fly on the user's device. They are temporary wallets useful for testing purposes. The private keys are generated and stored on the user's device.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet
  burnerWallet={{
    networkId: 0,
    provider: provider,
  }}
/>
```

### MetaMask Snaps [!toc]

MetaMask Snaps are a new way to extend MetaMask with custom functionality and integrations. You can check the implementation to integrate NuFi from the <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/apps/playground/src/components/cardano/connect-browser-wallet">GitHub repository</Link>.

Use the `injectFn` prop to add custom functionality.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet
  injectFn={async () => await checkIfMetamaskInstalled("preprod")}
/>
```

  ### Connect Wallet Component [!toc]

  Connect to user's wallet to interact with app

  ```tsx
  import { CardanoWallet } from '@meshsdk/react';

  export default function Page() {
    return (
      <>
        <CardanoWallet
          label={"Connect a Wallet"}
          persist={true}
          onConnected={()=>{console.log('on connected')}}
          cardanoPeerConnect={{
            dAppInfo: {
              name: "Mesh SDK",
              url: "https://meshjs.dev/",
            },
            announce: [
              "wss://dev.btt.cf-identity-wallet.metadata.dev.cf-deployments.org",
            ],
          }}
          burnerWallet={{
            networkId: 0,
            provider: provider,
          }}
        />
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
