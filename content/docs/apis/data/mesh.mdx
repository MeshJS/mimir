Mesh provides a full set of utility functions to help constructing the Mesh `Data` type you need for your Web3 app.

**Types Support**

All utility functions start with the prefix of m and all types All the utility functions start with the prefix of m, and are designed to return a type with the same naming as the utilities function, with capitalizing first letter, you can build your data with type supports in complex types, some examples:

- `mConstr` returns `MConstr` type
- `mBool` returns `MBool` type


## Utilities in Building Constructor Mesh Data

`mConStr` build the constructor object in Mesh `Data` type, with parameters:

- alternative (number) - the constructor index
- fields (any[]) - the constructor fields in array

There are also some quick utilities only taking in **fields** as parameters for 0 - 2 indices:

- `mConStr0` - building index 0 constructor
- `mConStr1` - building index 1 constructor
- `mConStr2` - building index 2 constructor

  Building Mesh constructor object

  ```tsx
  import { mConStr } from "@meshsdk/core";
  mConStr(0, []);
  ```

## Utilities in Building Primitives Mesh Data

`mBool` build the boolean object in , with parameters:

- b (boolean | boolean) - the boolean to be built

For the rest of data primitives, they are represented by JS primitives:

- Integer - `number` and `bigint`
- Byte string - `string`
- List - JS `Array`
- Map - JS `Map`

  Building Mesh bool object

  ```tsx
  import { mBool } from "@meshsdk/core";
  mBool(true);
  ```
