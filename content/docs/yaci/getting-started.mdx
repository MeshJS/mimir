## Mesh Hosted Yaci Devnet

### Connect right away with Yaci Provider [!toc]

Mesh has a hosted Yaci Devnet that you can connect to right away. You can use the following URL to connect to the hosted Yaci Devnet:

```bash
https://yaci-node.meshjs.dev/api/v1/
```

### Import Yaci Provider [!toc]

Import `YaciProvider` and start using it to interact with the Yaci Devnet.

```tsx
import { YaciProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new YaciProvider();
const params = await provider.fetchProtocolParameters();
console.log(params);
```

## Set up your system to run Yaci Devkit

### Download and install Docker [!toc]

You can download Docker from the official website. Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.

Go to the <Link href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/">Docker website</Link> and download the latest version, then follow the instructions to install it.

After installing, open the Docker Desktop app and make sure it's running in the background.

### Download the latest Yaci DevKit release [!toc]

Go to Yaci releases on Github and download the latest release. Under `Assets`, you will find the `yaci-devkit-version.zip` file.

Extract the zip file to a folder on your system. This folder will be your Yaci DevKit root directory.


## Start a Yaci Devnet

Open a terminal and navigate to the Yaci DevKit root directory. Run the following command to start the DevKit containers and yaci-cli:

```bash
$ ./bin/devkit.sh start
```

### Start node [!toc]

To create a new devnet, run the following command from yaci-cli:

```bash
yaci-cli:>create-node -o --start
```

To create a new devnet with Babbage era, run the following command from yaci-cli:

```bash
yaci-cli:>create-node -o --era babbage --start
```

To start a devnet with zero fees, run the following command from yaci-cli:

```bash
yaci-cli:>create-node -o --genesis-profile zero_fee --start
```

To start a devnet with 30 slots per epoch, run the following command from yaci-cli:

```bash
yaci-cli:>create-node -o -e 30 --start
```

After you have started your devnet, you can open Yaci Viewer from http://localhost:5173. Here you can view the blocks, transactions, and other details of the devnet.

If you want to configure the devnet, go to `config/node.properties`. And if you want to change settings and change default topup addreses, go to `config/env`.

You can use `YaciProvider` with the Yaci Store Api URL (http://localhost:8080/api/v1), to interact with the Yaci Devnet.

```tsx
import { YaciProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new YaciProvider('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/');
const params = await provider.fetchProtocolParameters();
console.log(params);
```

### Support external PostgreSQL database for indexer [!toc]

By default, Yaci DevKit's indexer uses an embedded H2 database. With this update, you can also configure an external PostgreSQL database.

For Non-Docker distribution, edit config/application.properties and uncomment the following properties to set PostgreSQL database details:

```bash
yaci.store.db.url=jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:<dbport>/<dbname>?currentSchema=<schema_name>
yaci.store.db.username=user
yaci.store.db.password=password
```

For Docker distribution, edit config/env and uncomment the following properties:

```bash
yaci_store_db_url=jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:<dbport>/<dbname>?currentSchema=<schema_name>
yaci_store_db_username=user
yaci_store_db_password=password
```


## Useful commands

Here are some useful commands to interact with the Yaci DevKit.

### Topup ADA [!toc]

After you have started your devnet, you can topup ADA in your wallet. To topup ADA in your wallet, run the following command from devnet:

```bash
devnet:default>topup <address> <amount>
```

For example:

```bash
devnet:default>topup addr_test1qpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0uafhxhu32dys6pvn6wlw8dav6cmp4pmtv7cc3yel9uu0nq93swx9 1000
```

### Check UTXO [!toc]

To check the UTXO of an address, run the following command from devnet:

```bash
devnet:default>utxos <address>
```

For example:

```bash
devnet:default>utxos addr_test1qpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0uafhxhu32dys6pvn6wlw8dav6cmp4pmtv7cc3yel9uu0nq93swx9
```

### Default address info [!toc]

You can get the default addresses of the devnet by running:

```bash
devnet:default> default-addresses
```

By default, wallet mnemonic is

```bash
test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test sauce
```

And it's address is

```bash
addr_test1qryvgass5dsrf2kxl3vgfz76uhp83kv5lagzcp29tcana68ca5aqa6swlq6llfamln09tal7n5kvt4275ckwedpt4v7q48uhex
```

### Stop Devnet and yaci-cli [!toc]

To stop the devnet, run the following command from devnet:

```bash
devnet:default>exit
```

To stop yaci-cli, run the following command:

```bash
yaci-cli:>exit
```

To stop the DevKit containers, run the following command from the Yaci DevKit root directory:

```bash
./bin/devkit.sh stop
```

Sometimes you just want to reset the devnet and start from scratch. To do that, run:

```bash
devnet:default>reset
```
