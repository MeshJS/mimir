The <Link href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/">Hydra Head protocol</Link> is a layer 2 scaling solution for Cardano rooted in peer-reviewed research that increases transaction throughput and ensures cost efficiency while maintaining rigorous security.

Get started:

```tsx
import { HydraProvider } from "@meshsdk/hydra";

// Hydra Head URL and PORT: e.g. http://123.45.67.890:4001

const provider = new HydraProvider('<URL>');
await provider.connect();
```


## Connect Hydra Head

Connects to the Hydra Head. This command is a no-op when a Head is already open.

```tsx
await provider.connect();
```


## Initializes a new Hydra Head

Initializes a new Head. This command is a no-op when a Head is already open and the server will output an `CommandFailed` message should this happen.

```tsx
await provider.init();
```


## Commit to Hydra Head

Commit a particular UTxO to the head. This will make the UTxO available on the layer 2.

```tsx
// Params: CommitUtxo, KeyToSign
await instance.commit("", undefined);
```


## Aborts a head

Aborts a head before it is opened. This can only be done before all participants have committed. Once opened, the head can't be aborted anymore but it can be closed using: `Close`.

```tsx
await provider.abort();
```


## New Transaction

Submit a transaction through the head. Note that the transaction is only broadcast if well-formed and valid.

You can also the `await provider.submitTx(signedTx)` method to submit a signed transaction.

The `newTx` method accepts the following arguments:

```tsx
async newTx(
  cborHex: string,
  type:
    | "Tx ConwayEra"
    | "Unwitnessed Tx ConwayEra"
    | "Witnessed Tx ConwayEra",
  description = "",
  txId?: string
)
```

Here is an example of how to create a transaction using the Hydra provider, Mesh wallet and Mesh transaction builder:

```tsx
async function makeTx() {
  const walletA = {
    addr: "addr_test1vpsthwvxgfkkm2lm8ggy0c5345u6vrfctmug6tdyx4rf4mqn2xcyw",
    key: "58201aae63d93899640e91b51c5e8bd542262df3ecf3246c3854f39c40f4eb83557d",
  };

  const wallet = new MeshWallet({
    networkId: 0,
    key: {
      type: "cli",
      payment: walletA.key,
    },
    fetcher: provider,
    submitter: provider,
  });

  const pp = await provider.fetchProtocolParameters();
  const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos("enterprise");
  const changeAddress = walletA.addr;

  const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
    fetcher: provider,
    params: pp,
    verbose: true,
  });

  const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
    .txOut(
      "addr_test1vpd5axpq4qsh8sxvzny49cp22gc5tqx0djf6wmjv5cx7q5qyrzuw8",
      [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "3000000" }],
    )
    .changeAddress(changeAddress)
    .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  console.log("txHash", txHash);
}
```


## Decommit

Request to decommit a UTxO from a Head by providing a decommit tx. Upon reaching consensus, this will eventually result in corresponding transaction outputs becoming available on the layer 1.

The decommit method accepts the following arguments:

```tsx
async decommit(
  cborHex: string,
  type:
    | "Tx ConwayEra"
    | "Unwitnessed Tx ConwayEra"
    | "Witnessed Tx ConwayEra",
  description = "",
)
```


## Close Hydra Head

Terminate a head with the latest known snapshot. This effectively moves the head from the Open state to the Close state where the contestation phase begin. As a result of closing a head, no more transactions can be submitted via NewTx.

```tsx
await provider.close();
```


## Contest

Challenge the latest snapshot announced as a result of a head closure from another participant. Note that this necessarily contest with the latest snapshot known of your local Hydra node. Participants can only contest once.

```tsx
await provider.contest();
```


## Fanout

Finalize a head after the contestation period passed. This will distribute the final (as closed and maybe contested) head state back on the layer 1.

```tsx
await provider.fanout();
```


## Listens for new messages from Hydra node

Listens for new messages from Hydra node. The callback function will be called with the message as the only argument. Check <Link href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/api-reference">all events emitted</Link> by the Hydra node.

```tsx
provider.onMessage((message) => {
  console.log("HydraProvider received message", message);
  // do something with the message
});
```

The callback function is typed, so you can access the message properties directly.

```tsx
provider.onMessage((message) => {
  if (message.tag === "Greetings") {
    console.log("message.snapshotUtxo", message.snapshotUtxo);
  }
});
```


## Fetch Address UTxOs

Fetch UTxOs controlled by an address.

```tsx
await provider.fetchAddressUTxOs('addr_test1qpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0uafhxhu32dys6pvn6wlw8dav6cmp4pmtv7cc3yel9uu0nq93swx9')
```

Optionally, you can filter UTXOs containing a particular asset by providing `asset`, where it is the concatenation of policy ID and asset.

```tsx
// Assest f.e. d9312da562da182b02322fd8acb536f37eb9d29fba7c49dc172555274d657368546f6b656e
await fetchAddressUTxOs(address: string, asset?: string)
```


## Fetch Protocol Parameters

Fetch the latest protocol parameters.

```tsx
await provider.fetchProtocolParameters()
```

Optionally, you can provide an epoch number to fetch the protocol parameters of that epoch.


## Fetch UTxOs

Get UTxOs for a given hash.

```tsx
await provider.fetchUTxOs('dfd2a2616e6154a092807b1ceebb9ddcadc0f22cf5c8e0e6b0757815083ccb70')
```

Optionally, you can specify the index of the index output.

```tsx
await provider.fetchUTxOs('hash_here', 0)
```


## Submit Transaction

Submit a serialized transaction to the network.

```tsx
await provider.submitTx(signedTx);
```
