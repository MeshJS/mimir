The Hello World smart contract is a simple lock-and-unlock assets contract, providing a hands-on introduction to end-to-end smart contract validation and transaction building.

There are 2 conditions to unlock the assets:

- Signer must be the same as the one who locked the assets
- Signer must provide the message `Hello, World!`

There are 2 actions (or endpoints) available to interact with this smart contract:

- Lock assets
- Redeem assets

### Install package [!toc]

First you can to install the `@meshsdk/contracts` package:

```tsx
npm install @meshsdk/contract
```

### Initialize the contract [!toc]

To initialize the contract, we need to initialize a provider, `MeshTxBuilder` and `MeshGiftCardContract`.

```tsx
import { MeshHelloWorldContract } from "@meshsdk/contract";
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider('<Your-API-Key>');

const meshTxBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const contract = new MeshHelloWorldContract({
  mesh: meshTxBuilder,
  fetcher: provider,
  wallet: wallet,
  networkId: 0,
});
```

Both on-chain and off-chain codes are open-source and available on <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/mesh-contract/src/hello-world">Mesh Github Repository</Link>.


## Lock Assets

This transaction locks funds into the contract.

The datum must match the representation expected by the validator (and as specified in the blueprint), so this is a constructor with a single field that is a byte array.

```tsx
pub type Datum {
  owner: VerificationKeyHash,
}
```

Thus, we provide a hash digest of our public key, which will be needed to unlock the funds.

```tsx
await txBuilder
  .txOut(scriptAddress, assets)
  .txOutDatumHashValue(mConStr0([signerHash]))
  .changeAddress(walletAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

  ### Lock Asset [!toc]

  Lock asset in the contract

  **Lovelace amount**
  `5000000`

  ```tsx
  const assets: Asset[] = [
    {
      unit: "lovelace",
      quantity: '5000000',
    },
  ];

  const tx = await contract.lockAsset(assets);
  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx);
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  ```
</Card>


## Unlock Assets

There are 2 conditions to unlock the assets:

- Signer must be the same as the one who locked the assets
- Signer must provide the message `Hello, World!`

The validator script for the contract checks that the redeemer is the same as the owner of the datum and that the message is `Hello, World!`:

```tsx
validator hello_world {
  spend(
    datum_opt: Option<Datum>,
    redeemer: Redeemer,
    _input: OutputReference,
    tx: Transaction,
  ) {
    expect Some(datum) = datum_opt
    let must_say_hello = redeemer.msg == "Hello, World!"
    let must_be_signed = list.has(tx.extra_signatories, datum.owner)
    must_say_hello && must_be_signed
  }

  else(_) {
    fail
  }
}
```

  ### Redeem Giftcard [!toc]

  Redeem a gift card given the gift card UTxO

  **Tx hash**
  `Tx hash`

  **Message**
  `Hello, World!`

  ```tsx
  const utxo = await contract.getUtxoByTxHash('');

  const tx = await contract.unlockAsset(utxo, 'Hello, World!');
  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx);
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  ```
