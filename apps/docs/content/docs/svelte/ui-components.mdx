Mesh provide a collection of useful UI components, so you can easily include web3 functionality and convenient utilities for your application.

## Connect Wallet

In order for apps to communicate with the user's wallet, we need a way to connect to their wallet.

Add `CardanoWallet` to allow the user to select a wallet to connect to your app. After the wallet is connected, see <Link href="/apis/wallets/browserwallet">Browser Wallet</Link> for a list of CIP-30 APIs.

The signature for the `CardanoWallet` component is as follows:

```tsx
{
  label?: string;
  onConnected?: Function;
  isDark?: boolean;
}
```

### Customization [!toc]

For dark mode style, add isDark.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet isDark={true} />
```

For a custom label, add the label prop.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet label={"Connect a Wallet"} />
```

The customization is limited. For more customization, you can easily build your own wallet connection component. You may also take reference from <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-react/src/cardano-wallet/index.tsx">this component</Link>.

### onConnected [!toc]

If you want to run a function after the wallet is connected, you can add the onConnected prop.

```tsx
export default function Page() {

  function afterConnectedWallet() {
    // do something
  }

  return (
    <>
      <CardanoWallet onConnected={afterConnectedWallet} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The above code will log "Hello, World!" to the console when the wallet is connected.
