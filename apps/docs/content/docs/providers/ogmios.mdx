<Link href="https://ogmios.dev/">Ogmios</Link> is a lightweight bridge interface for cardano-node. It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak Ouroboros' mini-protocols via JSON/RPC. Ogmios is a fast and lightweight solution that can be deployed alongside relays to create entry points on the Cardano network for various types of applications.

Get started:

```tsx
import { OgmiosProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new OgmiosProvider('<URL>');
```

## Evaluate Transaction

`evaluateTx()` accepts an unsigned transaction (`unsignedTx`) and it evaluates the resources required to execute the transaction. Note that, this is only valid for transaction interacting with redeemer (smart contract). By knowing the budget required, you can use this to adjust the redeemer's budget so you don't spend more than you need to execute transactions for this smart contract.

```tsx
const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const evaluateTx = await provider.evaluateTx(unsignedTx);
```

Example responses from unlocking assets from the always succeed smart contract.

```tsx
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "tag": "SPEND",
    "budget": {
      "mem": 1700,
      "steps": 368100
    }
  }
]
```

With the `mem` and `steps`, you can refine the budget for the redeemer. For example:

```tsx
const redeemer = {
  data: { alternative: 0, fields: [...] },
  budget: {
    mem: 1700,
    steps: 368100,
  },
};
```


## Submit Transaction

Submit a serialized transaction to the network.

```tsx
await provider.submitTx(signedTx);
```
