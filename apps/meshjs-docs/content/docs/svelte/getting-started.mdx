## Setup

The fastest way to get started a new project with Svelte is to use the Mesh-CLI, which will scaffold a new project for you. To do this, run the following:

```tsx
npx meshjs your-app-name
```

During the installation process, you will be asked to choose a template. Choose the Svelte template. This will scaffold a new Svelte project with Mesh pre-installed.

To manually, install the Mesh Svelte package, run the following:

```tsx
npm install @meshsdk/svelte
```

Next, add the Mesh CSS to your application, doing so will apply the default styles to the components. You can add this in `+layout.svelte`.

```tsx
<script lang="ts">
	import '@meshsdk/svelte/styles.css';
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

{@render children()}
```


## Connect Wallet

In order for apps to communicate with the user's wallet, we need a way to connect to their wallet.

Add `CardanoWallet` to allow the user to select a wallet to connect to your app. After the wallet is connected, see <Link href="/apis/wallets/browserwallet">Browser Wallet</Link> for a list of CIP-30 APIs.

The signature for the `CardanoWallet` component is as follows:

```tsx
{
  label?: string;
  onConnected?: Function;
  isDark?: boolean;
}
```

### Customization [!toc]

For dark mode style, add isDark.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet isDark={true} />
```

For a custom label, add the label prop.

```tsx
<CardanoWallet label={"Connect a Wallet"} />
```

The customization is limited. For more customization, you can easily build your own wallet connection component. You may also take reference from <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-react/src/cardano-wallet/index.tsx">this component</Link>.

### onConnected [!toc]

If you want to run a function after the wallet is connected, you can add the onConnected prop.

```tsx
export default function Page() {

  function afterConnectedWallet() {
    // do something
  }

  return (
    <>
      <CardanoWallet onConnected={afterConnectedWallet} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The above code will log "Hello, World!" to the console when the wallet is connected.

  ### Connect Wallet Component [!toc]

  Connect to user's wallet to interact with app

  ```tsx
  <script lang="ts">
    import { CardanoWallet } from "@meshsdk/svelte";
  </script>

  <main>
    <CardanoWallet />
  </main>
  ```
</Card>


## Get Wallet State

Obtain information on the current wallet's state, all fields on the `BrowserWalletState` JavaScript object are Svelte 5 runes, meaning when using the accessor, these values are reactive.

```tsx
<script lang="ts">
  import { BrowserWalletState } from "@meshsdk/svelte";
</script>
```

`wallet` is a <Link href="/apis/wallets/browserwallet">Browser Wallet</Link> instance, which expose all CIP wallets functions from getting assets to signing tranasction.

`connected`, a boolean, `true` if user's wallet is connected.

`name`, a string, the name of the connect wallet.

`connecting`, a boolean, `true` if the wallet is connecting and initializing.

  ### Wallet State [!toc]

  Get the current wallet's state

  ```tsx
  <script lang="ts">
    import { CardanoWallet, BrowserWalletState } from "@meshsdk/svelte";

    // Will run every time the underlying BrowserWallet instance changes.  $effect(() => {

      if (BrowserWalletState.wallet) {
        BrowserWalletState.wallet.getChangeAddress().then(address => {
          console.log(address);
        });
      }
    });
  </script>

  <div>
    <CardanoWallet />
  </div>
  ```
</Card>
